# Periodic Table

## Project Description

An interactive periodic table with some basic information and sample images for each chemical element. Designed to work comfortably on small screens.

* The user can hover over any element to see the sample or click on the element to see larger image and basic data. It is also possible to click through the elements in a manner similar to turning pages in a book.
    
* The periodic table remains conveniently usable on narrow screens and mobile devices, providing an additional interface to navigate it.
   
* A randomized animation with dynamically generated items runs in the background.
    
* This project can possibly be expanded into a larger educational website filled with more detailed information about the periodic table and each chemical element.
